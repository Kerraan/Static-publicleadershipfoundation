Eva Kleingeld is one of this years EPIC apprentices. During her apprenticeship Eva will regularly blog and vlog about
her MAD experiences. So this is the second time I am posting something about the EPIC apprenticeship. I decided to write
something this time as I feel more comfortable writing at this very moment. In this article, I will give some more
insights on the EPIC apprenticeship, finding my own leadership and the achievements and obstacles I encounter. Right
now, we are at the point that we had three training days of the EPIC apprenticeship. We have learned a lot during the
past three meetings. The last meeting, we defined our own Energy, Purpose, Identity and Courage. In my opinion, this was
very helpful. We paired up and talked about how we viewed each other in all of the matters. We provided each other from
helpful feedback. The atmosphere was cheerful (as always) and very open. The latter is so extremely important to me. I
have the feeling that this is also contributing to us learning more and more and I start to believe that openness is key
in learning about yourself. In the meantime I also met my coach (you get a personal coach during the apprenticeship who
helps you achieving your personal goals). We met up twice now. I was so happy to meet Dennis. He is not only a very
friendly and intellectual person, but he’s also a bit of an example to me. He is active in politics and he owns a
succesful company. He seems to be very passionate about everything he is doing. He gives me homework to achieve my goals
plus he gives me the right handles to apply in real life. Right now, I am reading two books for my “homework” (does not
really feel like homework as I love reading about philosophy).
